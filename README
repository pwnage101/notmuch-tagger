notmuch-tagger tags new messages in the notmuch database, based on
user-provided rules.  It is a intended to be useful in a post-new hook
(see the notmuch-hooks(5) manpage).

It prints summary to stdout containing the total number of messages
processed and the number of new messages not archived.  This output can
be made machine-readable by supplying the --json-output flag.

USAGE

notmuch-tagger [--dry-run] [--json-output] [<query-override>]

  --dry-run:
 
    Do not apply changes to tags, open the database in readonly mode.

  --json-output:

    Format the output as a json dictionary containing they following
    keys:

      "inbox" - the number of new messages not archived
      "total" - the total number of new messages

CONFIGURATION

notmuch-tagger reads tagging rules from ~/.notmuch-tagger.yml.  Each
rule specifies the *Fields* to search, the *Pattern* to match, and the
*Tags* to apply.  Rules that exist later in the config file have higher
priority.  Here is an simple example of a rule for a mailing list:

  - Fields: List-Id
    Pattern: ^<example-list\.example\.com>$
    Tags: +example-list +list -inbox

Please refer to notmuch-tagger.example.yml for more usage details and
examples.

You may invoke notmuch-tagger in your $DATABASEDIR/hooks/post-new so that every
invocation of `notmuch new' will result in your new mail being automatically
tagged.  Your post-new hook may be as simple as:

  #!/bin/bash
  notmuch-tagger

Or it may also notify the user when new mail arrives:

  #!/bin/bash
  # requirements:
  #   jq - lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor
  new_messages=$(notmuch-tagger --json-output | jq .inbox)
  if [[ $new_messages -gt 0 ]]; then
    notify-send "You have mail!"
  fi
