notmuch-tagger tags new messages in the notmuch database, based on
user-provided rules.  It is a intended to be useful in a post-new hook
(see notmuch-hooks(5)).

It prints summary to stdout containing the total number of messages
processed and the number of new messages not archived.  This output can
be made machine-readable by supplying the --json-output flag.

USAGE

notmuch-tagger [--dry-run] [--json-output] [<query-override>]

  --dry-run:
 
    Do not apply changes to tags, open the database in readonly mode.

  --json-output:

    Format the output as a json dictionary containing they following
    keys:

      "inbox" - the number of new messages not archived
      "total" - the total number of new messages

CONFIGURATION

notmuch-tagger reads tagging rules from ~/.notmuch-tagger.yml.  Each
rule specifies the *Fields* to search, the *Pattern* to match, and the
*Tags* to apply.  Rules that exist later in the config file have higher
priority.  Here is an simple example of a rule for a mailing list:

  - Fields: List-Id
    Pattern: ^<example-list\.example\.com>$
    Tags: +example-list +list -inbox

Please refer to notmuch-tagger.example.yml for more usage details and
examples.
